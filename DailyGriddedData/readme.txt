% README file for Daily Gridded Data
% 
% This file describes the format used by the Berkeley Earth project 
% for gridded data fields.  These fields contain reconstructed 
% daily temperature anomaly values generated by the Berkeley Earth 
% project based on our method of climate analysis.
%
% The current version of the daily dataset is an experimental product,
% and may be subject to substantial revision without notice.  It has
% yet been described in the peer reviewed literature.  We are releasing
% this dataset as is, in order to attract attention and get feedback 
% from potential users of this dataset.
%
% At present all gridded data is provided via the NetCDF format (version
% 4).  NetCDF, short for Network Common Data Form, is a standardized data
% format commonly used for the exchange of large data sets, including
% weather data.  Tools for reading NetCDF are available in most major
% programming languages, including Matlab, R, C++, and others.
%
% File Naming Convention
%
% Daily gridded data files have names with the format:
%
%    <dataset abbreviation>_<variable name>_Daily_<type specifier>.nc
%       or
%    <dataset abbreviation>_<variable name>_Daily_<type specifier>_<decade>.nc
%
% The <dataset abbreviation> indicates the temperature data set from which 
% the analysis was constructed.  Currently, the only valid value for this
% is "Complete", indicating that all data from the Berkeley Earth data set
% was used.  In the future, GHCN and other alternative data sets may also
% be added.
%
% The <variable name> is an indicator of the kind of data in the file.
% Currently, valid options are TAVG, TMAX, and TMIN indicating fields for
% average temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature,
% respectively.
% 
% The <type specifier> indicates the type of gridded data provided.
% Currently, the supported choices are "EqualArea" and "LatLong1".  
% "EqualArea", indicates a 15,984 element equal area grid which is the 
% format commonly used by the Berkeley Earth project to represent the globe 
% for many applications.  "LatLong1" is a resampled field using a 
% 1 degree-by-1 degree latitude-longitude grid covering the Earth.  This
% format is likely to be more useful for many applications.
%
% The <decade> specifier, if present, indicates that the data file contains
% only the associated decade worth of daily data.  For example, if a file
% specifies 1990 as the last element then it contains data from Jan 1, 1990 to
% December 31, 1999 inclusive.  We have broken the files into decadal segments
% in order to help users better manage the very large size of the aggregate data.
% A decadal block in the lat-long format can be as large as 450 MB within a
% compressed NetCDF and expand to about 900 MB in memory.
%
% File Contents
%
% The following variables are presently included in the gridded data set:
%
%    latitude
%    longitude
%    date_number
%	year
%	month
%	day
%	day_of_year
%    land_mask
%    temperature
%    climatology
%
% latitude: A list of latitude values indicating grid box centers.  For
%   the "EqualArea" product it lists every grid box, and for the "LatLong1"
%   product it lists the centers for a single column.  Values are in degrees,
%   with positive values used for the Northern Hemisphere.
%
% longitude: A list of longitude values indicating grid box centers.  For
%   the "EqualArea" product it lists every grid box, and for the "LatLong1"
%   product it lists the centers for a single row.  Values are in degrees,
%   with positive values used for the Eastern Hemisphere.
%
% date_number: A list of dates at which data is reported.  Data format is decimal
%   with year plus fraction of year reported, with each value corresponding
%   to the midpoint of the respective day.  For example, 2000.0123
%   indicates January 5, 2000.  
%
% year: A list of years at which data is reported.  Combine with "month" and 
%   "day" to form a full date.
%
% month: A list of months at which data is reported.  Combine with "year" and
%   "day" to form a full date.
%
% day: A list of days at which data is reported.  Combine with "year" and
%   "month" to form a full date.
%
% day_of_year: A list of the day of year (1-365) at which data is reported.  
%   This can be used with the "climatology" to select the appropriate climatology
%   day to use with each day of temperature anomalies.  During leap years, 
%   there will be one duplicated day_of_year value.
%
% temperature: A surface air temperature anomaly field.  For "LatLong1"
%   case, the dimension are latitude x longitude x date.  For the
%   "EqualArea" case, the dimensions are number of grid cells x date.  Each
%   element measures the local temperature anomaly, in degrees C, for the 
%   corresponding location and date.  Missing values are reported as NaN.  
%   A value is reported as missing if the grid cell is less than 5% land or
%   if the coverage diagnostic indicates that the locally available data 
%   provides less than a 20% constraint on the anomaly.
%
% land_mask: For each grid cell, the fraction of the cell which corresponds
%   to land (as opposed to ocean or other large water bodies).  
%
% climatology: For each grid cell, an estimate of the true surface
%   temperature for each day of year (1-365) during the period January 1951 
%   to December 1980 reported in degrees C.  For "LatLong1", the dimensions are 
%   latitude x longitude x day_of_year, where day_of_year has length 365.
%   For the "EqualArea" case, the dimensions are grid cell number x day_of_year.
